[Shyam Rallapalli](http://www.tsl.ac.uk/staff/shyam-rallapalli/)

I am a plant science graduate with a keen interest and experience in bioinformatic applications for research. I have an extensive knowledge of next generation sequencing and their applications, especially RNAseq, ChIPseq, variant analysis and genome annotation.

In my current role I am working on the alignments from Fraxinus, a citizen science project of short read sequence alignments by humans. Additionally I maintain [OpenAshDieBack (OADB) blog](http://oadb.tsl.ac.uk/) and [github](https://github.com/ash-dieback-crowdsource/data) and help [Martin Page](http://www.tsl.ac.uk/staff/martin-page/) with [OADB geeFu](https://geefu.oadb.tsl.ac.uk/).
